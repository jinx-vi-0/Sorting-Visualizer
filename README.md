# Sorting Visualizer

## Introduction

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer, an interactive web application designed to help you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This project uses bar heights to represent array elements, providing a clear and intuitive representation of how different sorting algorithms operate in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Randomize array function
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Algorithms

Sorting Visualizer currently supports the following algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Each algorithm is visually represented, allowing users to observe how elements are compared, swapped, and moved to their final positions.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using only front-end web technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
